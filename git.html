    <h2>Git commands</h2>
    <p>So I explored the following commands BY making a lot of mistakes and committing a few crimes.</p>
    <p>I was following a tutorial and entered the following command in git bash:</p>
    <p>git remote origin add www.github.com/myprofile/myreponame and</p>
    <p>git remote master add htttps://github.com/myprofile/myreponame</p>
    <p>You DON'T name your repository as master. That is just dumb.</p>
    <p>(I know, I know, I know, don't judge me, I still get confused because I do not have my basics clear.')</p>


    <h3>The Diagnosis of the above scenario</h3>
    <p>When we write:</p>
    <p><strong>git remote add origin [url]</strong></p>
    <p>It means that we are adding a remote repository of [url] and naming it as "origin".</p>
    <p><strong>git remote add origin https://github.com/profile/rep.git</strong></p>
    <p>Do not forget that github remote repo have .git extension in end of repository name.</p>

    <h3>git remote -v</h3>
    <p>This command displays all the messed up remote repositories you have made</p>

    <h3>git remote remove origin</h3>
    <p>This command deletes/ removes the messed up remote repository you made.</p>
